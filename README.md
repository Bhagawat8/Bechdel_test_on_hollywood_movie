# Bechdel_test_on_hollywood_movie_dataset

#### Project Description:
This project analyzes gender representation in Hollywood films through the Bechdel Test. Data from various sources will be collected on movie titles, genres, release years, and Bechdel Test results. Python's pandas and NumPy will be used for data cleaning and exploration. Visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and potentially Plotly will reveal trends in Bechdel Test pass rates across genres and years. The project aims to expose gender representation issues and spark discussions to promote a more balanced portrayal of women in movies.
